# Credential Line
# ---------------
# A credential line consists of the mount-point, the user-name and
# the password. The mount-point must be an absolute path, starting
# with /. The password may be omitted.
# For compatibility with older versions, instead of the mount-point
# the URL may be given. The URL must contain scheme, fully qualified
# domain name and path. If the path segment is missing, / is assumed.

# Examples
# /home/otto/foo                otto          g3H\"x\ 7z\\
# /media/dav/bar                otto          geheim
# Old style
# "http://foo.bar/my documents" otto          "geh # heim"
# https://foo.bar:333/dav       otto          geh\ \#\ heim
