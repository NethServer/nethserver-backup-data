# Proxy Line
# ----------
# A proxy line consists of the fully qualified domain name of the proxy,
# the user-name and the password. The proxy name must not contain a scheme
# or path segment, but a port number should be added, separated by a colon.
# The password my be omitted.
# Instead of the name of the proxy, the keyword "proxy" may be used.

# Examples
# foo.bar:3245                  otto          my\ secret
# foo.bar                       otto          "my secret"
# proxy                         otto          "my secret"
